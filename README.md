# Multiple Intelligences Aptitude Test

This Multiple Intelligences Aptitude Test is an Aptitude test based on the [Multiple Intelligences Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences).

It takes the result from the [Multiple Intelligences Aptitude Test form](https://forms.gle/aZYz7mvP2SnNtWQi8) through a text file, analyzes them and prints out the result which includes your aptitude for each intelligence type, a short description for each type and a list of professions you might be interested in pursuing.

### Features
* **Easy To Install** — All you have to do to install is extract the .zip file
* **Customizable** — Intelligences' data is stored in User-Friendly JSON files
* **Detailed Results** — Basically a career counselor if you're too broke to hire one
